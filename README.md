# Stonkz!

Stonkz is an AI designed to play the stock market
we plan to run it on an Rpi 3B+
it is not finished or operational yet

## Plans

we built a simple neural network, that can have any number of layers and neurons
we plan to make a superior config file so that its sizes of layers and neurons can be changed
and obtain past and present data 
we also plan to make different types of layers and activation functions
particularly:
* ReLu activations
* pooling layer
* convolving layer

then try to attach a Reinforcement learning architecture to it
and the ability to make transactions

## things to be done

 litterally everything
